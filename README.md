Prions are infectious proteins that, after entering a host, trigger typical host proteins to fold abnormally and conform to the prion protein shape. The prions predominately accumulate extracellularly in the central nervous system of a host. Ultimately, the accumulation of prions causes a fatal neurodegenerative disease by the formation of amyloid plaques and subsequent abnormal tissue structure. Many of the known prion diseases are found in mammals including humans (Kuru & Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), sheep and goats (scrapies), cattle ("mad cow" disease), and camels (camel spongiform encepalopathy, CSE). Prion diseases affecting animals are grouped into a family labeled transmissable spongiform encepalopathies (TSEs).

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a highly infectious TSE which affects cervids (*e.g.* white-tailed deer), elk, mule deer, and moose.
