# 2019-11-14 - Questions for Collaborators in Illinois

## General questions

Are there any specific demographic groups/classes that are targeted for sharpshooting?

Is there any information as to what "strain" of the prion infected each sample?

## Spatial targeting coupled with demographic weights

Verity et al. (2014) adapted the method of "geoprofiling" (GP, Rossmo 2000) to create spatial search priority lists for areas likely to be sources of infection. This method could easily be applied to the data from Illinois and provide management agencies with additional information as to where susceptible animals are getting infected. In addition, we would also like to develop sampling (or culling) weights based upon the burden of disease in specific demographic classes. By coupling both spatial targeting and demographic weighted sampling, we hope to provide a novel analysis into geographic locations and demographic classes of concern to field biologists tasked with managing cervid populations in CWD endemic areas.

## Sex-specific genotype frequency changes driven by disease pressure 

Previous research (Robinson et al. 2012) has shown evidence for disease-driven selection for some PRPN genotypes (96GS) in white-tailed deer. Male deer, however, are more susceptible to random mortality (hunting). Therefore, one might expect a higher selection coefficient seen in female white-tailed deer which have some allele that confers either some resistance or prolonged life after primary infection.

The data from Illinois should give us some indication of death rates given age, sex, and genotype. These differential death rates may provide some insight into the population and evolutionary dynamics that can be expected in white-tailed deer populations residing in CWD endemic areas.
