# 2019-11-14 - Questions for Collaborators in Illinois

## General questions

Are there any specific demographic groups/classes that are targeted for sharpshooting?

Is there any information as to what "strain" of the prion infected each sample?

## Spatial targeting coupled with demographic weights

Verity et al. (2014) adapted the method of "geoprofiling" (GP, Rossmo 2000) to create spatial search priority lists for areas likely to be sources of infection. This method could easily be applied to the data from Illinois and provide management agencies with additional information as to where susceptible animals are getting infected. In addition, we would also like to develop sampling (or culling) weights based upon the burden of disease in specific demographic classes. By coupling both spatial targeting and demographic weighted sampling, we hope to provide a novel analysis into geographic locations and demographic classes of concern to field biologists tasked with managing cervid populations in CWD endemic areas.

## Sex-specific genotype frequency changes driven by disease pressure 

Many studies have characterized genetic variation in white-tailed deer prion protein gene and how specific genotypes confer either susceptibility, an ability to cope with CWD (higher tolerance), or possibly partial resistance. Other research shows that demographic classes are infected at higher rates than others (older males vs. younger females). Robinson et al. (2012) show that differential rates of infection and death after infection are evidence for disease-driven selection. We would like to dive into the data available and investigate this disease-driven selection further with the questions below:

1. Is this disease-driven selection affecting demographic classes differently? Namely, is this selection seen only in male or female deer?
2. Can we model and, later predict, the genetic composition of white-tailed deer populations in CWD endemic areas?
