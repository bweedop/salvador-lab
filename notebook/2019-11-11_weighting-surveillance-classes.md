# 2019-11-11 - Using a Bayesian Weighted Surveillance Approach to Detect CWD

Management agencies are making an effort to refine their approach to sample susceptibles and detect CWD. Jenelle et al. (2018) demonstrate a Bayesian framework which management officials may use to establish sampling weights for surveillance classes (*i.e* demographic groups shown to be differentially affected by CWD). CWD case data originating from Wisconsin is first used to develop sampling weights that could be used to detect CWD in other areas where CWD has not been reported but may still be present. The authors showed this by using the weights to establish sampling efforts for CWD detection in Shenandoah National Park located in Virginia. This idea of being more direct in our sampling for efficient detection CWD could also be applied to culling populations in areas known to have CWD. 

## Targeting both spatial areas and demographics

Could we apply both spatial targeted and demographically-weighted sharpshooting to cull populations of cervids and elk to reduce CWD prevalence?
