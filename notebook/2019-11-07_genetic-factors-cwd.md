# 2019-11-07 - Genetics Factors and CWD

Robinson et al. [(2012)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/pri.19640) review ways in which CWD affects different prion protein (PrPc) genotypes found in white-tail deer, mule deer, and elk. These different genotypic responses are then related to how they might affect the population dynamics and spread of CWD, generally. 

## White-tail Deer

There is currently no evidence of any white-tail deer PrPc genotype that provides total resistance to CWD. There is, however, some genotypes that confer a higher tolerance to CWD which prolongs the latent and infectious periods. Robinson et al. briefly discuss the positive and negative effects that may come with an increased prevalence of high tolerance genotype individuals. I would
