# 2019-11-12 - A Better Understanding of Pathogen Spread Using Combined Data Sources

Fountain-Jones et al. (2019) combine a number of different data sources (landscape data, genetic data from both host and pathogen) in order to get a better understanding of how anthropogenic landscape alterations may affect the spread of a pathogen. There had been some previous work to show that each of these data sources would be important to tracking the spread of a pathogen but here the authors demonstrate how one may combine them to get a more comprehensive analysis. Within the context of CWD, there are a number of contrasting landscapes where CWD is being transmitted such as domesticated deer ranges vs. non-domesticated ranges or public land for hunting vs. private no hunting (low hunting) areas.
