## Smith et al. 2015 - Spatial targeting To Control M. bovis and Inform Badger Culls

Geoprofiling did not perform any better than a ring cull. "An important factor that limited the success of spatial targeting in this study is the uncertainty in the degree to which cattle TB results from badger to cattle transmission" (Smith et al. 2015). This same factor may limit the success of GP and other spatial targeting methods when focusing on CWD. It is still difficult to understand whether CWD infections are coming from the environment or other infected individuals. 

## Infection sources may be biased detection locations

We may have an issue with the fact that many deer found/killed with CWD could have been infected for a long period of time and/or also migrated over a long distance to ultimately be found in the area that we are labelling a hit. Furthermore, it is not clear whether we are identifying infection sources or areas where humans tend to go to find deer.
