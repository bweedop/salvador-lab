## Smith et al. 2015 - Spatial targeting To Control M. bovis and Inform Badger Culls

Geoprofiling did not perform any better than a ring cull. "An important factor that limited the success of spatial targeting in this study is the uncertainty in the degree to which cattle TB results from badger to cattle transmission" (Smith et al. 2015). This same factor may limit the success of GP and other spatial targeting methods when focusing on CWD. It is still difficult to understand whether CWD infections are coming from the environment or other infected individuals.
