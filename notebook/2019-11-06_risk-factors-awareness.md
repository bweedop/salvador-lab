# 2019-11-06 - Risk Factors To Note

I thought that it would be beneficial to note the potential risk factors and subtleties that might assist or complicate any spatial targeting methods used. The [USGS published (2012)] (https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20121036) guidelines and characteristics to be aware of when developing any sort of surveillance or monitoring methodologies specific to CWD. The authors of the first section discuss risk factors (attributes that may contribute to a greater probability of CWD) specifically. The different risk factors are separated into two groups: spatial and demographic. Both classes of risk factors may be exploited to increase the accuracy and efficiency of any surveillance and monitoring efforts. 

My effort here will be to distill some of the information in the publication down and relate it to later work.

## Spatial Risk Factors



### Introduction to New Area or Target Population

The authors note that CWD was introduced more recently (compared to Colorado and Wyoming) to Illinois and Wisconsin and spread follows distinct patterns from where it was likely first introduced  (Joly and others, 2003; Joly and others, 2006; Osnas and others, 2009; Heisey and others, 2010; Shelton and McDonald, 2011).

### Rate-Specific Spread Through New Area or Target Population

## Demographic Risk Factors

Genetics
    How can we target individuals that are susceptible rather than those that are protected from the disease?
